Hello,
although I put the code of part 1 and part 2 in the folder,
but you don't necessarily have to run them saparately,
because everything required is in the final version of shell.c

I test my code with the commands in the project description,
but I don't know if its gooing to handle all kinds of inputs.
If it crushed, please re-run the program and test the command as the first input and
see if I can get some partial points.

ps. my code managed to get 'ls' working,but I'm not sure if its the way professor required.

Thank you.
